Implementing a section of the paper "Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs" by Gulrajani et al. Specifically, we will implement the architecture designed for CIFAR-10 (the simpler version without residual layers, described in Section F). Appropriate modifications will be made for the Fashion MNIST dataset.
